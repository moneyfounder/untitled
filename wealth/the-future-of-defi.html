        <h2 class="H2" id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p class="P">Decentralized Finance, commonly referred to as DeFi, represents a revolutionary shift in the way financial services are structured and delivered. Unlike traditional finance (TradFi), which relies on centralized institutions such as banks and brokers, DeFi leverages blockchain technology to create an open and permissionless financial ecosystem. This innovative approach allows individuals to engage in financial transactions without intermediaries, thereby increasing accessibility, transparency, and efficiency.</p>

        <p class="P">The concept of DeFi has gained significant traction over the past few years, with the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols skyrocketing from a mere $1 billion in 2020 to over $100 billion in 2021. This explosive growth has attracted the attention of investors, developers, and regulators alike, prompting a deeper exploration of the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.</p>

        <p class="P">In this article, we will delve into the intricacies of DeFi, examining its key components, the factors driving its rise, and the potential it holds for reshaping the financial landscape. We will also address the challenges that must be overcome to ensure the sustainable growth of DeFi, including regulatory concerns, security risks, and user experience barriers. By the end of this exploration, readers will gain a comprehensive understanding of DeFi's current state and its future trajectory in the ever-evolving world of finance.</p>

  <section id="gold-mining">
    <h1 class="H1">Gold Mining: Unearthing Earth's Most Coveted Metal</h1>
    <p class="P">Mining gold has been a driving force in human development for thousands of years. Today, gold mining remains a vital global industry, responsible for producing thousands of tons of this precious metal annually. But extracting gold is no easy feat — it requires advanced technology, vast labor, and significant environmental considerations.</p>

    <h2 class="H2">Types of Gold Mining</h2>
    <p class="P">There are three main methods used to mine gold:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Placer Mining:</strong> This is one of the oldest methods, where miners extract gold from alluvial deposits in riverbeds, streams, and floodplains. Using simple tools like pans, sluices, and dredges, placer mining separates gold particles from sediment. Though often small-scale and artisanal, placer mining can still produce significant quantities of gold, especially in regions like Alaska and parts of Africa.</li>

      <li><strong>Hard Rock (Lode) Mining:</strong> This method targets gold embedded in rock veins beneath the earth's surface. Miners extract ore through tunnels or open pits, then crush and chemically process the rock to separate the gold. Modern hard rock mining uses explosives, heavy machinery, and sophisticated extraction techniques, enabling the recovery of gold from deep underground deposits. Large mining companies dominate this sector, operating mines in countries such as South Africa, Australia, Canada, and Russia.</li>

      <li><strong>Byproduct Mining:</strong> Gold is often recovered as a byproduct from mining other metals, such as copper, lead, and zinc. These operations treat ore primarily extracted for other valuable metals but extract gold as a valuable secondary product. Byproduct mining has become increasingly important as primary gold sources decline.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="H2">Environmental Impact of Gold Mining</h2>
    <p class="P">Despite gold’s beauty and economic importance, gold mining carries significant environmental challenges. The extraction and processing of gold ore can cause long-lasting ecological damage if not managed responsibly.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deforestation and Habitat Loss:</strong> Large-scale mining requires clearing land, often destroying forests and disrupting ecosystems. This threatens biodiversity and contributes to habitat loss for countless plant and animal species.</li>

      <li><strong>Water Pollution:</strong> The use of toxic chemicals like mercury and cyanide in gold extraction processes is a major environmental concern. These substances can contaminate rivers and groundwater, harming aquatic life and posing risks to human health. Mercury, particularly used in artisanal mining, is a potent neurotoxin.</li>

      <li><strong>Soil Erosion and Sedimentation:</strong> Mining activities disturb soil and rock layers, leading to erosion and sediment runoff into nearby waterways. This can degrade water quality and harm aquatic habitats.</li>

      <li><strong>Waste Generation:</strong> Gold mining produces vast amounts of tailings and waste rock, which may contain harmful substances. Proper disposal and management of mining waste are critical to preventing environmental contamination.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="P">In response to these issues, the gold mining industry and governments worldwide are increasingly adopting sustainable practices. Innovations include reducing mercury use, recycling water, rehabilitating mining sites, and employing more efficient extraction methods to minimize waste and ecological footprint.</p>
